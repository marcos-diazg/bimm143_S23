  <b>COVID-19:</b>  At the time of writing we are still in a major COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Whilst we are making every effort to support your learning in a safe in-person environment, we expect and require your help. Keeping our classroom community healthy takes all of us following campus safety requirements. You are expected to follow University public health requirements and pursue personal protection practices to protect yourself and the others around you from infection. These include:<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Participating in the university’s daily screening process</b>.
Everyone must complete a <a href="https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/return-to-campus/testing-and-screening/student-screening-and-testing/index.html#daily-screening">Daily Symptom Screener</a>.</li>

<li> <b>Participating in the university's testing program</b>.
All students are required to participate in the <a href="https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/return-to-campus/testing-and-screening/student-screening-and-testing/index.html#covid-testing">COVID-19 Testing program</a> in accordance with their vaccination status.</li>

<li> <b>Wear a well-fitting mask</b> that covers your nose and mouth at all times.
Everyone is required to wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status. If you see someone not wearing a mask, or wearing it incorrectly, kindly ask them to mask up. If you have concerns please bring them to my attention.</li>

<li> <b>Monitor potential exposures</b> and comply with contact tracing efforts.
Look out for the daily updates and potential exposure list that the university sends out with building information and the dates of exposure.</li>

<li> <b>Stay home if you’re feeling ill!</b>
If you’re not feeling well, complete the symptom screener and if needed, get <a href="https://health.ucsd.edu/coronavirus/Pages/testing.aspx">tested for COVID-19</a>. Do not come to campus unless given the all-clear. When you are able please contact me and I will make every effort to support your continued learning. We are all susceptible to COVID-19 illness-related disruptions and I have designed this course with pandemic resilience in mind.</li>
</ul></p>
I will do everything possible to help ensure that instruction is as safe as possible. This means that if conditions change and in-person instruction is no longer deemed as safe as it could be by the University and public health officials, we will pivot immediately to remote teaching. My hope is that this course can remain in-person and regardless of delivery mode serve as a venue where we build a vibrant supportive learning community.

The following UCSD website has many useful resources on <a href="https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu">returning to in-person learning</a>.

## Overview
Bioinformatics - the application of computational and analytical methods to biological problems - is a rapidly maturing field that is driving the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the avalanche of data in modern life sciences and medical research.  

This upper division 4-unit course is designed for biology majors and provides an introduction to the principles and practical approaches of bioinformatics as applied to genes and proteins.  

An integrated lecture/lab structure with hands-on exercises and small-scale projects emphasizes modern developments in genomics and proteomics. A detailed listing of all [lecture topics]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) is available and includes the major areas of: 

- Genomic and biomolecular bioinformatic resources, 
- Advances in sequencing technologies, 
- Genome informatics, 
- Structural informatics, 
- Transcriptomics, and 
- Bioinformatics data analysis with R.  

 Students completing this course will be able to apply leading existing bioinformatics tools to address biological questions. Our broader goal is to point towards perspectives that bioinformatics can expose for the integration and analysis of complex biological information. For further details please see our complete list of [course objectives and specific learning goals]({{ site.baseurl }}/goals/).
 

## Audience: 
Biology majors with upper division standing. A familiarity with basic biomedical concepts is essential (students should have successfully completed BILD1 and BILD4 or BIMM 101). No formal programming training or high level mathematical skills are required.  

## Accessibility:  
We are committed to making this course accessible to everybody. Please contact Dr. Díaz-Gay <mdiazgay@ucsd.edu> if you have questions regarding content accessibility.  

## Requirements: 
To fully participate in this course students will be expected to use their own computers with specific freely available [software installed]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/).    

## Schedule:  
**N.B.** For the Fall 2022 quarter, BIMM-143 will be offered **in-person only** on Tuesday and Thursday at 9:30 - 12:30 pm in TATA 2501 ([Map](https://goo.gl/maps/Cd8z9Zexx6q){:target="_blank"}).  Additional video lectures, screencast lab review sessions and supporting material will be available via this website on a weekly basis throughout the quarter.  A detailed [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) with class related material is provided online.  

## Class announcements:  
All announcements regarding the course will be by email to your UCSD address.  We will also be using [Piazza]({{site.data.authors.corelinks.piazza}}){:target="_blank"} to facilitate course communication, particularly around questions and answers. If you have a question outside of class or office hours, first check if it has already been asked on Piazza and if not post there. If you have a question or concern you don’t feel comfortable posting on Piazza feel free to reach out via email (<mdiazgay@ucsd.edu>).  

## Office hours:  
We will use [Zoom](https://ucsd.zoom.us/){:target="_blank"} on a weekly basis at a time to be determined from student polling. For now email me for a time and we will make it happen.
    

## Textbook:  
There is no textbook for the course. Lecture notes, homework assignments, grading criteria, video lectures, hands-on session screencasts and required reading material will be available from this public facing course website.  

## Syllabus:  
A detailed [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl}}{{site.data.authors.corelinks.syllabus}}){:.no-push-state} with topic outlines and learning goals is available for download.

## Surveys:
Please help us improve this course by completing by completing these surveys before and after the course. Thank you!
* [Pre-course questionnaire]({{ site.data.authors.corelinks.questionnaire }}){:target="_blank"}  
* [Post-course questionnaire]({{ site.baseurl }}/404/)  

## Acknowledgments:
In addition to working on personal laptops we will also be using remote supercomputing resources for analyzing bioinformatics data at scale. Our use of these resources is kindly supported by [NSF/XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) grant allocation TG-BIO170077.

To further support learning data analysis with the R environment we gratefully acknowledge support from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). DataCamp are providing our enrolled students with access to over 300 hours of data science videos and interactive coding challenges aimed at strengthening their data science skills.
